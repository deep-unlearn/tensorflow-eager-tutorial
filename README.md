# tensorflow-eager-tutorial

Simple tensorflow tutorial on python-like debbuging using Eager Execution mode

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File "tf_example_noEager.py' contains a standard tensorflow variable definition
with graph execution


File "tf_example_withEager.py" defines tensorflow variables that are imediate 
available (no need for graph execution). This allows for easy python like 
debbuging using standard breakpoint for check.


** Compatible with:
		- Python 2.7
